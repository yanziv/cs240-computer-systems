Write a succinct paragraph or two for each phase, describing:
- What the phase is computing with your input at a high level of
  abstraction.
- Some key features of the x86 code that correspond to the high-level
  computation.

Describe at a high level as if you are summarizing whatever C code
compiled to this assembly/machine code.  (Feel free to write C to
describe what is computed.) Do mention a couple assembly details that
figure prominently in how the low-level x86 code implements the
high-level structure, but do not give a line-by-line run-down of the
assembly code.
